**第比利斯36小时**

**36hours of Tbilisi
**



视频在文末／Scroll down for the video





认识一座城，需要几天时间？

How many days does it take to get to know a city?







和一个陌生人共同为一座城拍一个城市科普片，需要几个小时？

How many hours does it take to shoot a city video with a stranger?





我和Paul在Mother of Georgia（第比利斯地标性建筑，也是城市光高点）认识，生日的那一天我爬上了顶端，正在一个人享受这城市的美好夜景和远处的教堂发出的淡黄色的光。

I met Paul at Mother of Georgia (the landmark of Tbilisi, also the view point of the city). On the day of my birthday, I climbed to the top and was enjoying the beautiful night view of the city and light yellow light of the church in the distance. 



他和一群小伙伴风风火火晃了过来，喊着：

He and a group of friends rushed over and said:

 

“哎呀这个城的河和我在秘鲁看到的好像”

"Oh, the river in this city really like what I saw in Peru." 

“没有吧，我在秘鲁没见过这条河呀”

"No, I have never seen this river in Peru."



于是两个都曾经在南美土地上的生活过的人便攀谈起来。

So two people who have lived on the land of South America had a little chat.





原来Paul也是个数字游民，他有一家公司并且也拍视频，主题一般是城市和人文故事。喜欢在一个城市起码呆上一个多月慢慢感受，两个人的旅行观一拍即合。

Paul is also a digital nomad. He has a company and also makes videos. The themes are generally related with cities and humanities. He likes to stay in a city for at least a month and feel the city slowly. The two people’s travel concept is a hit.



我们连决定来第比利斯的理由都相似：**被朋友种了草，随意挑了一天买了机票就过来了。**

We even decided to come to Tbilisi for similar reasons: **Gotten the advice from our friends, and  picked a day casually to buy a plane ticket and came over.**



“我想给第比利斯拍个片子，你来一起玩吧”

"I want to make a film for Tbilisi.Do you want to shot the video with me?"

“好呀”

"Okay"



于是在向当地人与其它生活在城里的数字游民与游客询问后，我们在相识的第三天，花了6个小时为第比利斯拍下了这个片子。

So after asking the locals and other digital nomads and tourists who lived in the city, we spent six hours on the third day of acquaintance filming this film for Tbilisi.





原来，认识一座城，是这么“慢”而“迅速” 的过程。

It turns out that knowing a city is such a "slow" and "rapid" process.



而认识城里的这些人，也是那么轻而易举而有趣：我与Paul和其他几个数字游民以及旅者便顺其自然成了可以hang out（出去玩耍）的一群人。

It is also easy and fun to know these people in the city: I ,Paul and several other digital nomads and travelers have naturally become a group of people who can hang out.



也希望你的旅程，也能以这种方式，“高效”地慢慢了解一座城的内在与城里的可爱之人。

I also hope that your journey, in this way, can slowly and deeply understand the inner and inner of the city and the lovely people in the city.



毕竟，**世界那么大，还有那么多故事在等着我们去创造。**

After all, **the world is so vast, there are so many stories waiting for us to create.**
